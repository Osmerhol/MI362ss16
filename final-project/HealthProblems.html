			Health Problems</h1>

		<p>There are many mental health problems that people can suffer from, like depression, that can come
			from things like growing older, living in high-anxiety environments, or chemical imbalances.</p>

		<p>Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder.
			It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as
			sleeping, eating, or working.</p>

		<p>There is also post traumatic stress disorder, or (PTSD), which is a mental disorder that can develop
			after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or
			other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related
			to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues,
			alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and increased arousal. These symptoms last for more than a
			month after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress but instead may express their
			memories through play.</p>

		<p>Those with depression or PTSD are at a higher risk of suicide.</p>

		<p>Dementia is another common mental health problem that people may experience. It is not a specific
			disease, but an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory
			or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities.
			Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases. Vascular dementia, which occurs after a
			stroke, is the second most common dementia type. But there are many other conditions that can cause
			symptoms of dementia, including some that are reversible, such as thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.</p>

		<p>These diseases, as well as issues like substance abuse and sometimes obesity, more often than not, can
			be treated with medication. There is, however, another mode of treatment that is becoming more and more
			popular, called pet therapy.</p>

		<p>Pet therapy is defined as a guided interaction between a specially trained animal and an individual or
			group, facilitated by the animal’s handler. Also known as animal-assisted therapy, pet therapy interactions
			are used to help improve patients’ mental, social, emotional, and physical functions.</p>

		<p>Therapy can take place in a wide range of settings including hospitals, care homes, and treatment
			centers and can involve different activities such as walking, looking after, and grooming the therapy
			animal. Just like any other form of treatment, the specific components of the pet-therapy program are
			decided on a case-by-case basis so they address the particular needs of each patient.</p>
