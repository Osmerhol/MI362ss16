			Health Benefits</h1>

		<p>[1] Research has shown that the positive effects that dogs can have on a person can be applied
			in a therapeutic setting. Leveraging the power of pets is becoming a vital tool in the treatment
			of a variety of medical conditions and disorders.</p>

		<p>Trained animals are used to benefit patients suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders,
			depression, autism, substance abuse, and dementia.</p>

			Mental Health</h2>

		<p>Petting an animal is believed to cause the release of endorphins (feel-good neurotransmitters) which
			can have an extremely positive impact in patients dealing with depressive disorders. More detailed
			and developed interventions are often based on the premise that by focusing on the animal and its
			needs, the patient’s attention is drawn away from their own problems. Patients also have an opportunity
			to develop their nurturing skills and are encouraged to develop a sense of empathy with the animal.</p>

			Dementia</h2>

		<p>Dogs and other animals have taken part in visiting programs to assisted living centers for elderly
			people for many years. Although this type of interaction can certainly lift the spirits of those living
			in such centers, Alzheimer’s experts felt more could be gained through structured animal-assisted
			intervention programs.</p>

			Substance Abuse</h2>

		<p>Therapy animals have also been successfully used within treatment programs for individuals with
			substance abuse issues. The presence of an animal can in itself help calm the patient down and
			prepare them to face their demons.</p>

		<p>Addicts often focus almost exclusively on themselves. Engaging with an animal can encourage
			them to think about the needs of others. Delivered in a group setting, addicts are also more likely
			to interact socially with others if an animal is involved. Doctors observing how the addict deals with
			the animal also get a greater insight into the patient’s self-esteem issues, helping them identify
			specific coping mechanisms and healthier new behaviors.</p>

		<p>Often integrated into counseling programs, animal therapy can help addicts learn more about teamwork,
			communication, trust, and self-expression. Animals can also introduce some fun into sessions which
			can help defuse tension during challenging discussions.</p>

			Other Benefits of Dogs</h2></p>

		<p><h3>Studies have also found that [2]:</h3></p>

		<p><b>—</b> Dog owners are less likely to suffer from depression than those without pets.</p>

		<p><b>—</b> People with dogs have lower blood pressure in stressful situations than those without pets. One study even found that when people with borderline hypertension adopted dogs from a shelter, their blood pressure declined significantly within five months.</p>

		<p><b>—</b> Playing with a dog or cat can elevate levels of serotonin and dopamine, which calm and relax.</p>

		<p><b>—</b> Pet owners have lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels (indicators of heart disease) than those without pets.</p>

		<p><b>—</b> Heart attack patients with dogs survive longer than those without.</p>

		<p><b>—</b> Pet owners over age 65 make 30 percent fewer visits to their doctors than those without pets.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons for these therapeutic effects is that dogs (and cats) fulfill the basic human need to touch. Even hardened criminals in prison have shown long-term changes in their behavior after interacting with dogs, many of them experiencing mutual affection for the first time. Stroking, hugging, or otherwise touching a loving animal can rapidly calm and soothe us when we’re stressed or anxious. The companionship of a pet can also ease loneliness, and most dogs are a great stimulus for healthy exercise, which can substantially boost your mood and ease depression.</p>

			Older Patients</h2>

		<p><b>Dogs have been known to positively affect in healthy aging by:</b></p>

		<p><b>— Helping find meaning and joy in life.</b> As you age, you’ll lose things that previously
			occupied your time and gave your life purpose. You may retire from your career or your children
			may move far away. Caring for a dog can bring pleasure and help boost your morale, optimism, and
			sense of self-worth. Choosing to adopt a dog from a shelter, especially an older dog, can add to the
			sense of fulfillment, knowing that you’ve provided a home to a pet that may otherwise have been euthanized.</p>

		<p><b>— Staying connected.</b> Maintaining a social network isn’t always easy as you grow older.
			Retirement, illness, death, and relocation can take away close friends and family members. And
			making new friends can get harder. Dogs are a great way for older adults to spark up conversations
			and meet new people.</p>

		<p><b>— Boosting vitality.</b> You can overcome many of the physical challenges associated with aging
			by taking good care of yourself. Dogs, and to a lesser degree cats, encourage playfulness, laughter,
			and exercise, which can help boost your immune system and increase your energy.</p>
