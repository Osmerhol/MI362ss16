		<p>Dogs and humans have always had a very symbiotic relationship. Studies have shown that having a dog can
		lead to some very positive lifestyle changes.</p>

		<p>[1] Adopting healthy lifestyle changes plays an important role in easing symptoms of depression,
			anxiety, stress, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. Caring for a dog can help you make healthy lifestyle
			changes by:</p>

		<p><b>— Increasing exercise.</b> Taking a dog for a walk, hike, or run are fun and rewarding ways to fit
			healthy daily exercise into your schedule. Studies have shown that dog owners are far more likely to
			meet their daily exercise requirements—and exercising every day is great for the animal as well. It will
			deepen the connection between you, eradicate most behavior problems in dogs, and keep your pet fit and
			healthy.</p>

		<p> </p>

		<p><b>— Providing companionship.</b> Companionship can help prevent illness and even add years to your
			life, while isolation and loneliness can trigger symptoms of depression. Caring for a living animal
			 can help make you feel needed and wanted, and take the focus away from your problems, especially if you
			 live alone. Most dog and cat owners talk to their pets, some even use them to work through their troubles.
			 And nothing beats loneliness like coming home to a wagging tail and wet kisses.</p>

		<p><b>— Helping you meet new people.</b> Dogs can be a great social lubricant for their owners,
			helping you start and maintain new friendships. Dog owners frequently stop and talk to each other
			on walks, hikes, or in a dog park. Dog owners also meet new people in pet stores, clubs, and training
			classes.</p>

		<p><b>— Reducing anxiety.</b> The companionship of a dog can offer comfort, help ease anxiety,
			and build self-confidence for people anxious about going out into the world. Because dogs live in the
			moment—they don’t worry about what happened yesterday or what might happen tomorrow—they can help you
			become more mindful and appreciate the joy of the present.</p>

		<p><b>— Adding structure and routine to your day.</b> Dogs require a regular feeding and exercise schedule.
			Having a consistent routine keeps a dog balanced and calm—and it can work for you, too. No matter your
			mood—depressed, anxious, or stressed—one plaintive look from your dog and you’ll have to get out of bed
			to feed, exercise, and care for your pet.</p>

		<p><b>— Providing sensory stress relief.</b> Touch and movement are two healthy ways to quickly manage
			stress. Stroking a dog lowers blood pressure and can help you quickly feel calmer and less stressed.</p>
